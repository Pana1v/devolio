Concluding my tenure as the Undergraduate Representative for the AY 2024-2025 at Students' Gymkhana, IIT Patna. I am immensely proud of what we, the Academic and Career Council (ACC UG), have achieved.

5. Formalization and establishment of Research Community, conduction of Research Conclave.
6. (TBA) Development of an entirely new site for IIT Patna, with massive help from the STC Dev Team.
7. Organization of Farewell events (Yearbook '25) ranging from Sports to Cultural activities, with due credits to the Yearbook Design team, Sports Council, HoSCA and its coordinators.
8. Enhancing student experience through:

   - Documentation of Academic Procedures through a comprehensive site and the "ACC Survival Guide"

   - Initiated monthly "Ask the ACC" sessions for transparent communication.

    - Launched a mentorship program pairing UG students with research scholars and faculty.
12. **Mental Health & Wellbeing Initiatives:**

    - Helped set up a peer support network for students.
13. **Digital Transformation:**  
    - Pushed for digitization of academic records and online application systems for scholarships and internships.
    - Oversaw the launch of the new ACC portal for centralized student resources.
14. **Inclusivity & Outreach:**  
    - Supported initiatives for first-generation college students and students from underrepresented backgrounds.
    - Organized orientation programs and Q&A sessions for incoming batches.

These milestones were truly a team effort. A massive thank you to the VP Gymkhana Shubham Satyam; fellow Gymkhana Core Members Kirtan Jain, Ankit Kumar, Shivam Kumar Dubey, Suryansh Bansal, Soureesh T V S S and all the passionate Members of the Academic and Career Council (ACC) – Rishabh Raunak, Aditya Yadav, Ruchi Chand Thakur, and Hemanth Kumar Katariya, the wider Gymkhana family and Deans, Faculties and Staff who assisted me throughout these endeavours.

I wish all the best to the upcoming UGR Yash Raj to continue the momentum and all Juniors who I hope will take whatever amount of effort is required to leave this #IIT in a better place than we found it.
